<!-- ### General Intellectual Functioning -->

Mr. Lopez's general intelligence is in the Average range, with crystallized
intelligence and working memory also in the Average range. Processing speed and
overall cognitive efficiency are average, with no significant strengths or
weaknesses. However, fluid reasoning is in the Low Average range, suggesting
potential difficulties with abstract thinking and problem-solving. A
comprehensive assessment of neuropsychological functioning, encompassing
attentional and executive functioning, language, spatial processing, and memory,
is also in the Low Average range.
