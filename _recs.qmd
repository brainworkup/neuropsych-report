In terms of treatment amenability, Mr. Lopez acknowledged multiple problem areas in
his life and expresses a generally positive attitude toward lifestyle changes
and taking responsibility for his actions. In general, treatment strategies
oriented towards increasing motivation for change will be the most beneficial
for Mr. Lopez. Specific recommendations include the following:

- Individualized instruction in reading remedation. Mr. Lopez and his mother should visit the
   [International Dyslexia Association (IDA)](https://dyslexiaida.org/) and the
   [Learning Disabilities of America (LDA)](https://ldaamerica.org/) websites
   for information and resources.

- Remedial instruction in spelling and writing.

- Behavioral therapy to address attention and mood problems.

- Mr. Lopez reported a relative lack of social supports in his life at this time. People who report low social support typically have few close personal relationships or are generally dissatisfied with the quality of those interpersonal relationships. Rehabilitative efforts should focus some effort on increasing his network of prosocial associates and peers in the appropriate context.
