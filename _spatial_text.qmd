<!-- ### Visuospatial Functions  -->

Mr. Lopez demonstrated Average skills in perceptual processing and pattern
matching, as well as inductive reasoning and non-verbal problem-solving. His
ability to construct and recreate abstract visual designs was also Average.
However, he struggled with tasks requiring visuospatial integration, such as
copying a complex abstract figure, where his performance fell in the Low Average range.
