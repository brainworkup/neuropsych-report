<!-- ### Language Functions -->

Mr. Lopez evidenced average auditory comprehension, word-finding ability, and verbal reasoning, demonstrating a good understanding of spoken language, ease in conversation, and the ability to draw conclusions from verbal information. However, the patient's performance in categorical/semantic word fluency and letter/phonemic word fluency is Low Average and Below Average respectively. This suggests potential difficulties in generating words that fall into specific categories or begin with a specific letter, which may impact tasks that require organizing verbal information or need rapid verbal responses.
