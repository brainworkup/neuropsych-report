## Summary and Formulation

### General Cognitive Abilities

Biggie Lopez is a 23-year-old left-handed male with a history of reading disability and attention problems who was referred for neuropsychological testing as part of a comprehensive forensic work-up. General cognitive ability is within normal limits, and there is no evidence of decline from premorbid estimates. No deficits were detected in the domains of attention, processing speed, or visuospatial skills. Many aspects of executive functioning, language functioning, and memory were within normal limits; however, Mr. Lopez demonstrated mildly inefficient problem solving and planning, weaknesses in phonemic word retrieval (which is common in dyslexia), and inefficiency in new learning of verbal information. Even with these subclinical areas of relative weakness, these findings suggest that Mr. Lopez's cognitive functioning is generally intact and within normal limits. With the exception of reading impairments, he does not show any significant cognitive impairments that would interfere with his daily life activities.

### Reading Skills

Mr. Lopez's reading abilities, including reading decoding, reading
comprehension, and reading speed/fluency are significantly limited and
consistent with a *specific learning disorder in reading*. His
neuropsychological profile and psychosocial history are consistent with
*developmental dyslexia*, which impairs his reading skills. He described at
great length the negative impact of his reading difficulties on his academic and
social functioning in his youth. He reported that he has always has had to work
harder than his peers to achieve the same results.   

In practical terms, Mr. Lopez's deficits in sight
vocabulary fluency could lead to challenges in interpreting written language,
including difficulties in understanding instructional manuals or other
text-based materials. His deficits in word-level and text-level reading could
lead to difficulties in understanding complex textual content, such as literary
works, and also impact basic comprehension tasks, such as responding to
multiple-choice questions. Further, deficits in reading decoding hinder his
ability to comprehend unfamiliar words, thereby further obstructing overall
understanding. Weak reading comprehension results in challenges in
discerning the central idea of a text, making logical inferences, and impacts
higher-order cognitive skills. He also demonstrated difficulties in decoding,
particularly with irregularly spelled words, making it difficult to phonetically
sound out unknown words. These impairments can lead to difficulties in
understanding written language, comprehending complex texts, recognizing
unfamiliar words, understanding the main idea of a text, making inferences, and
decoding words accurately and rapidly.

### Attention/Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

Parent ratings of ADHD symptoms and executive dysfunction indicated that Mr. Lopez has difficulty with formulating and implementing plans to complete complex tasks independently and efficiently. He also has difficulty staying focused on tasks and following through on instructions, leading to decreased productivity across multiple areas. To an extent, parent reports suggest he may also struggle to effectively regulate his emotions in difficult situations. Furthermore, he is likely to have difficulty organizing his thoughts and time, resulting in disorganized work or incomplete tasks. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of ADHD, which was apparent in childhood and continues to impact his daily functioning.

### Neuropsychiatric Profile

Mr. Lopez has a documented history of depression and anxiety, and a reported
history of drug use problems. The co-occurrence of these disorders increases
the severity of both and requires integrated treatment approaches that address
both mental health and substance use issues. However, these conclusions are somewhat
tenuous at this time, given the difficulty Mr. Lopez had in completing the 344-item
measure of personality and psychopathology that provides a more objective
assessment of these areas. Still, based on his documented
history and multiple clinical interviews, unspecified mood and substance use
disorders appear to be part of the clincial picture as well.

Of note, there is no question that adults with ADHD are more likely to use various
substances than other adults. Alcohol is the most frequently abused
substance--up to a third of adults with ADHD have or have had a drinking
problem. The trouble is that the nature of substance use disorders, combined
with the nature of ADHD, can make it difficult to see oneself as having a "real"
problem. People in the general population often take a long time to recognize
they need help and then seek it. With self-awareness limited by the executive
function deficits of ADHD, admitting that one has and then addressing a
substance use disorder can be even harder.
